        <p> My name is Sonia Portaluppi. I study Public Relations with a specialization in Business Administration at the University of Florida.</p>
        <p>Before landing on public relations as a career path, I wanted to become a journlaist. As a passionate writer, I thought at the time that this should be what I would dedicate my life to. It wasn't until I researched the creative aspect of business that I discovered public relations.</p>
        <p>I found this major to be the perfect blend of two roles I could see myself fulfilling: communicator and businesswoman.</p>
        <p>Although the internships I partook in were not specifically "public relations internships," the discipline of public relations was used on a daily basis both strategically and creatively. As a future public relations practioner, my mentors have assured me that it is essential to be exposed to every aspect that goes into a public relations strategy.</p>
        <p>These internships focused on marketing, social resposibility, fashion, luxury products, social media management and content creation. All of these are integral skills to anyone in the public relations field. </p>
